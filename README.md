pathpattern (software)
========================

Graph analysis of branching interactive works.

Pathpattern is a software library for converting branching structures and visualizing their network motifs as glyphs ("elements") and glyph sets ("signatures"). Includes methods for converting, importing and outputting TGF format, edge lists, and Edger-compatible 'sparse edge lists' for later visualization using Edger.  Also includes prototype methods for extracting Twine game hypertext fiction data structures from JavaScript/HTML; these may later be spun off into a different project.

Pathpattern-generated glyph sets ("signatures") are used in the Transverse Gallery project to demonstrate the inventory and frequency of elements in gamebooks. They are catalogued under the Elements view:

For example, this is a signature containing the elements of _Choose Your Own Adventure: The Cave of Time_.

Pathpattern is implemented in Python 2.
